              <h2>Bio.</h2>
              <p class="intro">
                Alexis is a bright young woman who graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 
                and is currently a student at Wayne State University attending law school. She first wanted
                to become a lawyer after attaining a law clerk position in a good friend's law office. Alexis 
                comes from an extremely eccentric family including two brothers and a set of wonderful parents
                who support her in all her endeavors. She's won several awards for her achievements and continues
                to earn high marks in all of her studies.

                    <h3>"...redefining what a woman can do."</h3>
                    <p>
                      "For me, there's no doubt that Alexis is a highly motivated and driven individual. She is absolutely 
                      redefining what a woman can do, and it turns out that they can do everything a man can do and more. 
                      Alexis once held two jobs while going to school full time among keeping a healthy and fit lifestyle
                      by going to the gym and taking the time to eat right. Working full-time and earning top grades in your class
                      is not something that usually goes together. My sister is the epitome of a powerful, strong, intelligent woman,
                      and I grow prouder of her everyday." <strong>-Joey Zerbst, Alexis's brother.</strong>
